1. Thanks for clicking on my games link. This is a towerdefense/RPG hybrid.

2. The top left is the RPG section. It is action/rythym based.  PRESS Q when close to the center to scrore high damage. If its blue, press Q to defend against your enemy. Make sure to get the rythym down and increase your combo count. Press W to Heal. Don't overuse it though. 

3. The tower defense is (hopefully) intuitive. Drag from the top right, and bring your towers to the center. It shouldn't be TOO difficult. 


TL;DR Do everything on the bottom left. Press Q in the right spot for the top left RPG. Press W to heal. "
